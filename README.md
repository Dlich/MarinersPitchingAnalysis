# Mariners Pitching Analysis Project

Hailing from Seattle, The Seattle Mariners are my favorite MLB baseball team. I love the history behind the team, the struggles the team has had to overcome and the culture of the team. Growing up in Seattle throughout the 2000/2010's, I had never seen the Mariners make the playoffs in my life, but during the 2022 season the Mariners finally broke their 21 year playoff drought. 

This was an incredible moment for all Mariners fan and our pitching was a big aspect on why we were able to finally break the drought, thus I wanted to analyze our pitching to determine how well we were actually pitching.
