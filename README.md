# Mariners Pitching Analysis Project

As a Seattle native, I've always been passionate about the Seattle Mariners, my favorite MLB baseball team. The rich history, the team's tenacious spirit in the face of challenges, and the unique culture surrounding it have captivated me. Growing up in Seattle throughout the 2000s and 2010s, I had never witnessed the Mariners make the playoffs in my lifetime. However, the 2022 season marked an extraordinary turning point as the Mariners finally shattered their 21-year playoff drought.

This monumental achievement brought immense joy to Mariners fans, including myself. It was particularly fascinating to observe the crucial role played by our pitching staff in this triumph. Consequently, I embarked on an in-depth analysis of our pitching performance to assess the true effectiveness of our team on the mound.
